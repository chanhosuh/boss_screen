At a startup, far, far way, some coworkers and I noticed that building docker images always made you [look busy](https://dilbert.com/strip/1994-12-16).  Thus the idea was born: a highly effective [boss screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_key) that could be easily implemented from memory at any new job with only minimal knowledge of Docker.

## Instructions
- type `make up` at the command line
- for greater effect, particularly on large monitors, create multiple terminals, each running the command
- to use as a true "boss key", create a keyboard shortcut to launch a terminal arrangement running the command and whatever else is needed to make you look busy
